SUMMARY="Python bindings for the low-level FUSE API"
DESCRIPTION="
Python-LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE API. It requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and 3.x. Like FUSE itself, Python-LLFUSE is developed for Linux systems. However, we try to maintain compatibility with OS-X, FreeBSD and NetBSD as well (but due to lack of pre-release testers we canâ€™t guarantee that every Python-LLFUSE release will run on these platforms - please report any bugs and we will try to fix them).
